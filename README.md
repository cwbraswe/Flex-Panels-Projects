# Flex-Panels-Projects
This project demonstrates various JavaScript features implemented in a Flex Panels page. Each feature is showcased in its own panel, providing an interactive and informative experience for users.

Features
1. JavaScript Drum Machine
The JavaScript Drum Machine feature simulates the sounds of different parts of a drum set corresponding to the letter pressed on the keyboard. Each drum set part is labeled, allowing users to play drum sounds by simply pressing the corresponding letter key on their keyboard.

2. Slide-in on Scroll
The Slide-in on Scroll feature enhances the visual experience of a web page by animating the appearance of images as the user scrolls down the page. The images slide in smoothly from outside the view, creating an engaging effect and drawing attention to the images.

3. Multiple Selection in Checklist
This feature enables users to select multiple items in a checklist simultaneously using the shift-click method. By holding the Shift key and clicking on different items in the checklist, users can easily select multiple items at once, streamlining the selection process and improving user efficiency.

4. Dynamic Word Shadow
The Dynamic Word Shadow feature adds an interactive element to text by creating a "shadow" effect that follows the mouse cursor as it moves around the word. This effect adds a visual touch to the text, enhancing the overall user experience and making the text more engaging.

5. Image Border Background
The Image Border Background feature generates a border around an uploaded image that matches the main color of the image. By extracting the dominant color from the image, the border dynamically adjusts its color to create a visually cohesive and harmonious appearance between the image and its surrounding border.
